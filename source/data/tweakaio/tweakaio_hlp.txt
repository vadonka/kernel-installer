NETWORK TWEAKS:
***************
TCP/IP tweaks
Accepted values are: on, off
Default is "on"

VM MANAGEMENT AND KERNEL TWEAKS:
********************************
Compcache option pre-requiered kernel based zram support.
You can adjust the compcache/swap zram device size and cache clear interval time.

VMTWEAKS accepted values are: on, off
Default is "on"

COMPCACHE accepted values are: on, off
Default is "off"

CS_SIZE (Compcace size) accepted values are numeric or "auto"
Default is "100" (in MiB)

CS_RATIO (Compcache ratio) accepted values are numeric, only applyed when CS_SIZE set to "auto"
Default is "20" (in %)

INTERVAL (Drop cache interval time) accepted values are numeric
Default is "4" (in hour)

MOUNT OPTION TWEAKS:
********************
Mount tweak remount all partition with noatime, nodiratime option and fine tune some IO parameters.
You can adjust the default IO scheduler too.
CM7 default scheduler is the bfq.
Its a good compromise between  the old anticipatory and the cfq scheduler
Since BFQ developement is still in progess, currently the latest version is v3r2.
Its far more better than the other schedulers so highly recommended to use BFQ.

MTWEAKS accepted values are: on, off
Default is "on"
SCHEDULER accepted values are: noop, deadline, cfq, bfq, sio
Default is "bfq"

CPU UNDERVOLT:
**************
You can define the voltage levels.
The init script limited the minimum voltage levels for safety reason,
so you cant undervolt too much.
The first value is the CPU freq level, the second is the voltage level

CPU undervolt is disabled by default
CPU_UV accepted values are: on, off
Default is "off"

DALVIK CACHE CLEANER:
*********************
Clean the outdated dalvik cache entries.
Modded by trev for synergykingdom additional mods by bigrushdog for Tiamat Xoom Rom
thanks Team Synergy and TrevE
you guys rock!

DALVIK_CLEANER accepted values are: on, off
Default is "off"

DEFRAG SQLITE3 DATABASES:
*************************
Defrag SQLite3 databases

SQLITE_DEFRAG accepted values are: on, off
Default is "off"
